# ATM Project

### About the project
This is an ATM interface, created for CSC 340 at EKU. 
When the user starts the program, they must log-in with their PIN, and it must match an existing PIN in the system.
Once logged in, the user can access and perform transactions on their multiple bank accounts
They can deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money between accounts, and check their balance.
Once done, the user can press "sign out" at the bottom to exit the ATM.


### How to run
After cloning the project, run the ATMProject.exe to open the program.
Enter PIN "1111" to log-in as a dummy customer (users will be able to create their own customer in a future update)
Deposit, withdraw, transfer, and check your balance at your choosing.


**Note**: There is a $3000 daily limit on transactions for each customer's account.
